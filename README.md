# 📊 Excel Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Excel Data Analytics** project — where I explored real-world job data from the data science industry to gain salary insights, identify in-demand skills, and build a compelling story through dashboards and analytical reports. The project is divided into two parts:

---

## 📌 Project Sections

### 🔹 Salary Dashboard

This section focuses on creating an interactive **Salary Dashboard** using Excel. It allows users to filter and analyze job salaries based on **job title, employment type, experience level, and location**. The dashboard was built using pivot tables, data validation, and Excel charts to help job seekers visualize compensation trends and find opportunities in the data industry.

### 🔹 Salary Analysis (with Power Query, Pivot & DAX)

In this section, I performed a deeper analysis using **Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX**. The goal was to answer questions like:
- Do more technical skills lead to higher salaries?
- What are the highest-paying regions and job titles?
- Which skills are most in demand?

I used **Power Query** for data cleaning, **Power Pivot** to model the data, and created DAX measures to analyze relationships between skills and pay.
